    <p class= "crisis-info">The following information can be found at <a href= "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/ColumbiaGlacier">this website.</a> The Columbia Glacier is a huge glacier located in the midst of the Chugach Mountains. Starting in the 1980s, the glacier has retreated 12 miles from the shoreline. Then from 2000 to 2006, the retreated pasued because there were two large peaks in its way. Because the glacier could not melt in size, it started to melt in thickness. In 2014, the glacier got so thin that it started to lose traction with the bedrock. Therefore, about 7 miles of the glacier slid into the ocean. The glacier has recently lost 1,300 feet of thickness and has retreated 10.5 miles. The Columbia Glacier is only one of about 200,000 glaciers around the globe that are experiencing the affects of climate change. We can all contribute to helping reduce to rate at which glaciers are melting by: 
    <li>Save power by taking shorter showers or turning the lights off.</li>
    <li>Reduce your carbon footprint by walking instead of driving somewhere.</li.>
    <li>Reduce your consumption of natural resources.</li>
