# OSMOSIS
Website for people to be educated on climate issues and shop sustainably in an open and honest space while providing a learning experience 

Problem: Animals and environments of the world are suffering due to climate change, yet many young and old individuals are unaware of the 
pressing issues. By evaluating this problem, the conclusion my group and I came up with was to create a space where people can be educated
on climate issues and shop sustainably in a open and honest space while providing a learning experience. 

There were many functions that we learned throughout our time at Kode with Klossy we incorporated as listed: a navigation bar to hamburger
menu on smaller devices, climate literacy quizzes/forms, maps with onclick thumbtacks, a flexbox photo gallery/blogs post, a slideshow, 
DOM manipulation to make a sign up for updates section, and more.
