    <p class= "crisis-info">The following information can also be found at <a href= "https://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/threats-to-the-reef/climate-change">this website.</a>The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef and one of the seven wonders of the world. Climate change is causing the water temperature to rise, the ocean's acidity to increase, and fluctuating tidal patterns. In February 2020, the water temperature was 1.2Â°C higher than the average temperature from 1960-2000. These high water temperatures is causing the corals to have a higher mortality rate, the fish to have odd mating seasons, and the budding seasons for the seagrass. The ocean's acidity has increased by 26% from pre-industrial times. The increase in carbon dioxide from human emissions has caused this increase in acidity. Fish eggs are sensitive to high pH levels, therefore, some baby fish die in the egg. Coral skeletons are also sensitive to higher pH levels. This means that coral is reproducing and growing at a very slow rate. The warming climate is causing an increase in cyclones and storms. Between 1958 and 2012, cyclones were responsible for 48% of the coral loss. Given that cyclones are becoming more frequent makes scientists nervous for the future of the Great Barrier Reef. Some ways that you could help solve this issue include:
    <li>Cut down on sunscreen use when you go in the ocean.</li>
    <li>Avoid purchasing real coral to put into aquariums.</li>
    <li>Save energy when possible.</li>
