    <p>The following information can be found at <a href= "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/ColumbiaGlacier">this website.</a>The Columbia Glacier is one of the most rapidly changing glaciers in the world. Since the 1980s, the front of the glacier has retreated by 12 miles. From 2000 to 2006, the glacier did not retreat anymore because it was stuck behind two mountian peaks. Therefore, the glacier started to ge thinner at an increasing rate. In 2014, the glacier got so thin that it lost traction with the bedrock, launching nearly 7 iles of glacier into the ocean. The rising temperatures, due to climate change, are increasing the rate at which glaciers are melting and incresing the lengths of the summer months. The Columbia Glacier is just one of about 200,000 glaciers in the world that are experiencing the same phenomenon.
