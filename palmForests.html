    <p class= "crisis-info">The following information can be found at <a href= "https://www.rainforest-rescue.org/topics/palm-oil/questions-and-answers"> this website.</a> Palm oil is the cheapest oil so it is in very high demand. In order for oil palm trees to thrive they ust be in a rainforest climate. This is causing companies to cut down trees around the Amazon so that there is more room for oil palms. This is creating the largest deforestation in the world. This is causing the wildlife to die out or move into the cities. In addition to the loss of biodiversity, the destruction of large amounts of rainforest is creating a slight increase in the carbon dioxide levels. This increase is caused by the lack of trees that would usually convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. Some ways to help solve the palm oil crisis include:
    <li>Avoid palm oil and find a more sustainable oil to cook with. Olive oil is great.</li>
    <li>Avoid purchasing goods from corporations sourcing material from endangered forests.</li>
    <li>Donate to organizations that are trying to save the biodiversity in endangered forests.</li>
