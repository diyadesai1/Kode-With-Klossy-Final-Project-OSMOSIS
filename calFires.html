      <p class= "crisis-info">The following information can also be found at <a href= "https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/">this website.</a>In 2020, there were 4,257,863 acres of land burned in California. Of this, there were 33 confirmed deaths and 10,488 houses/stores that were destroyed. Climate change is caused by the greenhouse effect which is trapping heat and carbon dioxide in our atomsphere. Hotter air temperatures dry the forest and vegetation which makes the risk for wildfires skyrocket. If we allow the temperatures to keep rising, we are making an oath to ourselves that we are willing to risk fire destroying millions of people's homes and belongings. Ways to prevent huge wildfires include: 
      <li>Building wildfires far from dry grass and flammable items.</li>
      <li>Avoid fireworks and campfires in windy conditions.</li>
      <li>Cautiously burn debris and farm waste.</li>
